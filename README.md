# Projects
Projects to begin building a portfolio. 

In the following months I will be focusing building a portfolio of projects for anyone interested in what I am doing. Types of projects that will be included are:

1. Machine Learning:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - kNearest-Neighbors (kNN)
  - K-Means
  - Random Forest
  - Dimenstionality Reduction Algorithms
  - Gradient Boosting Algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
2. Computer Vision:
  - Image Segmentation
  - Object Detection
  - Facial Recognition
  - Edge Detection
  - Pattern Detection
  - Image Classification
  - Feature Matching
3. Natural Language Processing:
  - Optical Character Recognition
  - Speech Recognition
  - Machine Translation
  - Natural Language Generation
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Semantic Search
  

There will be constant updates to the directories as I progress. My goal is to complete at least one project in the list by August 2022. However, I will be placing heaving emphasis on Computer Vision as it is has been my growing interest.
